      <p>Physical and human environments are changing faster than ever and many
        pressing questions require characterization of change over space and
        through time. New spatial technologies (e.g., Satellites, GPS, and
        Google Maps) are providing opportunities to investigate spatial-temporal
        processes but methods are required to best utilize data. Generally,
        Dr. Nelsonâ€™s research develops and uses spatial and spatial-temporal
        analyses to address applied questions in ecology, forestry, and health.
        Dr. Nelson is particularly interested in developing approaches to quantify
        space-time change in landscapes (i.e., biodiversity) and phenomena that
        use landscapes (i.e., wildlife).</p>

            <p>Generally, my interests lie in mapping and monitoring land use, ecosystems, species distributions and habitats, within the contexts of environmental conservation and management. Past research and work experience has taken me from British Columbia, to Saskatchewan, to the Canadian High Arctic, and to the Ecuadorian Andes. My PhD research builds on these experiences, and involves using a variety of remotely sensed data with spatial and statistical modeling to derive baseline biodiversity maps at several spatial scales. My research will help fill gaps in the knowledge of spatial distribution of biodiversity (species and ecosystems). This type of knowledge is essential when assessing risks to biodiversity from natural and anthropogenic disturbances.</p>

Exposure to high concentrations can pose significant health risks. As a result, I will also be developing accessible and interactive cartographic applications to not only better communicate the risk of radon in general, but also to help the public identify which areas of the province are at a higher risk for exposure. </p>
