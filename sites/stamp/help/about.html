The methods in this software were developed during my master's thesis research. Originally I was looking for an existing method for analyzing hot spot polygons from different time periods. The methods I found with the most potential were developed by Dr. Yukio Sadahiro in two papers in 2001, yet they were not implemented in software anywhere. Additionally, the methods were limited to immobile polygon data, and would not be suitable for my research, which was looking at changing ecological phenomena over time. My intial implementation of Sadahiro's work was expanded to incorporate a number of movement events and include some new approaches for directional calculations. <br />
