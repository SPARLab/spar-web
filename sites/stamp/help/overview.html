<td valign="top">Spatial-temporal analysis of moving polygons (STAMP) is software for analyzing changes in multiple polygon layers inside ArcGIS. There are fairly strict data requirements for using this code, as the method was developed to address a specific research problem. However, I hope the tools here will still be useful to some people tasked with analyzing change in polygonal data. 
<br /><br />
<i>Single Part Features</i><br />

Input polygon data need to be simple, one-part features. This means that one polygon is associated with one record in the table. If you have mutli-part polygons you can create single-part features by using the “explode multi-part features” tool on the Advanced Editing Toolbar in ArcMap. 
<br /><br />
<i>Spatially Exclusive Polygons</i><br />
This simply means that polygons should be topologically correct (non-overlapping).
<br /><br />
<i>Temporal Resolution</i><br />
Polygon layers should be evenly distributed through time. For example, all polygons could be from different years if you are interested in exploring annual change (i.e. urbanization), or from different days if you’re interested in more quickly changing phenomena (i.e. wildfire), but the temporal intervals should be constant between consecutive layers.<br /><br />

<tr><td><b>Basic Procedure</b></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td>The basic procedure for running a STAMP analysis is as follows:<br />
1) Check input polygons are spatially exclusive with the <a href="utility.html">Polygon Utility</a><br />
2) Run the <a href="overlay.html">Polygon Overlay Tool</a><br />
3) Compute <a href="voronoi.html">Voronoi Polygons</a> <br />
4) Compute <a href="metrics.html">Polygon Metrics</a> <br />
Note: it is best to run these one after another and examine results at the end. Some of the processes depend on the layers being in the original order in the map's table of contents.
